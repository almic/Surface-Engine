## Setup

If you've used premake before and know how to setup the project files you want, the relevant script
to point premake to is `premake.lua`.

If you haven't, you can setup project files for your operating system with Premake, which you need
to download yourself and save to `vendor/premake`.

Get Premake: https://premake.github.io/download/

Once you have downloaded the Premake binaries and saved them to `vendor/premake`, run the setup script
for your operating system in the `script` directory from the terminal.
