To keep the repository download a bit more lean... Premake binaries are not included.

If you have premake on your system path, great! Use premake how you normally would.

If you need to get premake, download the latest version from the link below, save it here,
then run the build script in `scripts` directory.

Get Premake: https://premake.github.io/download/
